### My Patches
These patches use open souce code (usually C++) that Ive then integrated into my own projects and patches
splite : uses Madrona Labs code for the soundplane, note: it is depend on my SoundplaneLite project


### How I use these patches

 I create a link in the bela projects to patches i want to use 
```
cd ~/Bela/Projects
ln -s ~/projects/BelaPatches/salt/c++/splite
```

if you want you can rename, e.g. to include as a loop 
```
cd ~/Bela/Projects
ln -s ~/projects/BelaPatches/salt/c++/splite loop_1_splite
```
