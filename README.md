# Bela Patch 
a collection of patches for the various variations of BELA by bela.io - https://bela.io

Bela is a 'addon' board for the BeagleBone Black/Green,  providing low latency audio, analog and digial i/o

BELA   - just the plain Bela board
SALT   - a flexible Eurorack module made in collaboration with Rebel Technology
PEPPER - a flexible DIY Eurorack module this is passive so much cheaper than SALT but with limitations



These are patches Ive made for my own use, or may have adapted from elsewhere
note: they may or may not be up to date, or working ;) 


# initial setup 
I clone the repository into a directory e.g.
```
mkdir ~/projects
cd ~/projects
git clone https:https:/github.com/thetechnobear/BelaPatches
```


Some patches (particulary my C++ ones), will need to have external libraries built
